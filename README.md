[Wiki](https://github.com/PSASchool/9447H-ChangeUp/wiki#9447h-vex-vrc-2020-2021-change-up-robotics-code)

## Getting Started

- This is a PROS project, so you will need PROS.
> Download [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/).
- Clone and open the project in PROS.

## Using this Code

To edit the Auton Builder, edit the member function `Auton::run` in [auton.cpp](https://github.com/PSASchool/9447H-ChangeUp/blob/master/9447H-ChangeUp/src/class/control/auton.cpp).

To find out what member functions do look at the header files in [/include/class/control](https://github.com/PSASchool/9447H-ChangeUp/tree/master/9447H-ChangeUp/include/class).

All motor & sensor declarations/definitions are in [globals.h](https://github.com/PSASchool/9447H-ChangeUp/blob/master/9447H-ChangeUp/include/globals.h) and [globals.cpp](https://github.com/PSASchool/9447H-ChangeUp/blob/master/9447H-ChangeUp/src/globals.cpp).

## Other Info about features

The Auton Builder was built specifically for Change Up but the idea can be implemented in any season.
